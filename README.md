[DeepSeek-R1: Dynamic Quantization Model](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic) talks about the new AI advancements made in China by DeepSeek. This open-source model rivals top-tier systems like OpenAI's O1 but is cheaper to run.

The highlight is how the Unsloth team cut the model size from 720GB to 131GB—an 80% reduction—without losing functionality. By carefully adjusting bit usage for different layers, they avoided problems like gibberish outputs and made the model usable even on less powerful hardware. This makes advanced AI accessible to more people. Selective quantization reduces model size while keeping quality high. **Works on More Devices**: Run on just 20GB of RAM or optimize with GPUs.
